This mini-workshop will introduce you to recent developments that enable work with spatial data 'in the tidyverse'. By this we mean handling spatial datasets using functions (such as ` %>% ` and `filter()`) and concepts (such as type stability) from R packages that are part of the metapackage **tidyverse**, which can now be installed from CRAN with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This functionality is possible thanks to **sf**, a recent package (first release in 2016) that implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

The workshop will briefly introduce both packages (which should be installed on your computer before attending) before demonstrating how they can work in harmony using a dataset from the **spData** package, which can be installed with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
```

The workshop is based on our work on the forthcoming book *Geocomputation with R* - please take a look at the book and its source code prior to the workshop here: [github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr).

# Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- In R, packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensely popular and now they are a part of the **tidyverse**
- These packages use the 'tidy data' principles for consistency and speed of processing (from `vignette("tidy-data")`):


>    - Each variable forms a column.
>    - Each observation forms a row.
>    - Each type of observational unit forms a table

- Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the **tidyverse**

# Enter sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*
    
That's the topic of this workshop

# Geocomputation with R

- A book we are working on for CRC Press (to be published in 2018)
- Chapters 3 and 4 of this book form the basis of the worked examples presented here

---

# Prerequisites

- Install the required packages. You need a recent version of the GDAL, GEOS, Proj.4, and UDUNITS libraries installed for this to work on Mac and Linux. More information on that at https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#installling.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

- Load the ones we need:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(spData)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
```

- Check it's all working, e.g. with this command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world %>%
  plot()
```

<!-- My ideas for the workshop content: -->
<!-- 1. how to read vector data -->
<!-- 2. how the sf objects are structured  -->
<!-- 3. how they are different from the sp objects -->
<!-- 3. how to convert sf to sp, and sp to sf -->
<!-- 4. how apply non-spatial operations on the sf objects (combined example of subsetting, aggregation, joining) + how to remove a geometry from the sf objects (with plots) -->
<!-- 5. how to apply spatial operations on the sf objects (combined example of spatial subsetting and aggregation) (with plots) -->
<!-- 6. how to save vector data -->
<!-- 7. mention the raster package (it's not very tidyverse, however you can adjust it, for example using sfraster) + stars -->
<!-- 8. one more time mention the book + encourage people to contribute -->
