# Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- In R, packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensly popular
- These use 'tidy data' for consistency and speed of processing, from ):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("tidy-data")
```


>    - Each variable forms a column.
>    - Each observation forms a row.
>    - Each type of observational unit forms a table

- Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the **tidyverse**

# Enter sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of 3 previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*
    
That's the topic of this workshop

# Geocomputation with R

- A book we are working on for CRC Press (to be published in 2018)
- Chapters 3 and 4 of this book form the basis of the worked examples presented here


---

# Prerequisites

- Install the required packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

- Load the ones we need

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(spData)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
```

- Check it's all working, e.g. with this command:

```{r}
world %>%
  plot()
```
