  This article traces the development spatial data visualisation methods and capabilities in statistical statistical software since the beginning of the 21^st^ Century. Although the focus is on R, the progression from rudimentary and inflexible bitmap images to interactive online maps is applicable to other languages for statistical programming. The paper is primarily a historical review of the evolving state of the art, with the finding that making informative and aesthetically pleasing maps with R has become a more intuitive and interactive process over time. A secondary purpose of the paper is dissemination of best practice (with reproducible and extensible examples) in the field with a view to the future developments in the context of R's rapidly evolving spatial capabilities.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

# R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
